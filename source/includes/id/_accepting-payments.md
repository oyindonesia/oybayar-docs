## VA Aggregator

Businesses are struggling to manage hundreds or even thousands of physical bank accounts that are used for different purposes. It causes significant overhead cost in terms of the amount of account maintenance and man hours needed for reporting and reconciliation purposes, combining different information from different accounts.

Virtual Account (VA) is essentially a dummy account that is linked to a physical account and has all the physical account characteristics that enables a much easier reporting and reconciliation process by centralizing the money flow into the physical account. By issuing VAs, you can assign each VA for specific person and/or purposes.

![API VA Aggregator](../images/va_diagram_1.png)

From the example above, it shows how payments made through the VAs are merely pass-throughs for the physical accounts to receive money. Without VAs, the above example might require up to 8 physical accounts from 2 different banks rather than 2 physical accounts from 2 different banks.

**OY! API VA Aggregator**

Our API VA Aggregator product provides you with the capabilities to create unique Virtual Account (VA) numbers as a bank transfer payment method for your customers while the fund movements take place through OY!'s physical account. It provides you with the capabilities to receive payments from your customers via bank transfer without having each respective bank account across multiple banks.

Our virtual accounts are adjustable according to your needs. We offer options of static or dynamic accounts, single or mutli use accounts, opened or closed amounts, and determinable expiration dates. You can also track all created virtual accounts, incoming payments, and their respective details either through our API callback or the OY! dashboard.

### Key Features

1. **Create VA number via API** - Create VA automatically by integrating your applications with our API VA. For more information, visit our [API Docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/).

2. **Create VA number via Dashboard** - Do not have enough resources to integrate with API VA? Do not worry, you can create a VA number easily via OY! Dashboard. No need to write some codes!

3. **Support multiple banks** - Currently, we support virtual accounts (VA) at 8 banks: BCA, BNI, Mandiri, BRI, Permata, CIMB Niaga, SMBC, and Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI)

4. **Real-time settlement for majority of the banks** - Payment into a VA will settle in your OY! dashboard on a real-time basis for the majority of the banks (note: for BCA, the settlement will take place H+2 after payment is made into the VA)

5. **Transaction tracking and monitoring capability** - You can track all created VA, incoming payments, and their respective details through our API callback or the OY! dashboard. You will receive a callback all incoming transactions.

6. **Customizable VA types** - You can customize the VA numbers you want to create. Each VA would consist of three categories you can define in the creation process. Refer to the table below for more information on various types of VA:

| Category        | Type/Feature                  | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Validity Period | Static Virtual Account        | VA that has a lifetime validity. It will always be active until it is manually deactivated                   |
| Validity Period | Dynamic Virtual Account       | VA that has a specific validity period. It will always be active until it is expired or manually deactivated |
| Amount Type     | Closed Amount Virtual Account | VA that only accepts payment of a specific amount/declared amount                                            |
| Amount Type     | Opened Amount Virtual Account | VA that accepts payment of any amount                                                                        |
| Usage Frequency | Single Use Virtual Account    | VA that expires after a single payment. A single use configuration can only be set up for a dynamic VA       |
| Usage Frequency | Multiple Use Virtual Account  | VA that only expires when expiration date is reached or when it is manually deactivated                      |
| VA Number       | Customized or predetermined   | You may personalize the VA suffix using the numbers you want (e.g. your end-users' phone number or billing number). To enable VA number customization, please contact your Business Representative         |

7. **Capability to update VA** Attribute that can be updated:
   * amount
   * is_single_use
   * email
   * trx_counter
   * expired_time
   * trx_expired_time
   * username_display

Example:

* A static VA with a closed amount can be updated with a new closed amount hence it can work as a bill to be paid for a particular customer
* A static VA can be updated to a single use so it will be the last payment received from a particular customer

All of the VA information, even after they are updated, is available on the OY! dashboard or via API. Once a VA is updated, the new set of configuration will apply for that VA and the previous configure is overridden and no longer applicable

**Creating API-generated test links**

1. Create an account
2. Send a request to activate API Payment Link product and obtain staging API Key to your business representative
3. Create a payment link by sending a ‘POST’ request to https://api-stg.oyindonesia.com/api/payment-checkout/create-v2. Enter the required and optional fields, as referenced in the [API reference docs](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#api-create-payment-checkout)

Note: The link generated via API will always be a one-time link.

**Accessing and monitoring the created test payment links**

Whether you create the link through dashboard or API, you can see the details of your link on the OY! Dashboard. The details that can be checked are the created date of the link, amount billed, amount received, expiration date, and status.

**Mock Amount Values for Testing**

During testing, you can set the transaction amount to a certain mock value to simulate a specific scenario.

| Payment Method       | Scenario                                                                                                                                                                 | Criteria                                          | Expected Result   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| E-Wallet - ShopeePay | Payment already successful on E-Wallet issuer side but failed on OY side (can be due to callback timeout reasons). The transaction is refunded to the end-user's balance | Amount is between 55,000 and 66,000               | Refund Successful |
| QRIS                 | Payment already successful on E-Wallet issuer side but failed on OY side (can be due to callback timeout reasons). The transaction is refunded to the end-user's balance | Amount is between 55,000 and 66,000               | Refund Successful |
| E-Wallet - LinkAja   | Payment already successful on E-Wallet issuer side but failed on OY side (can be due to callback timeout reasons). The transaction is refunded to the end-user's balance | Amount is between 55,000 and 66,000               | Refund Successful |
| E-Wallet - ShopeePay | Failure during refund process                                                                                                                                            | Amount is less than 55,000 or greater than 66,000 | Refund Failed     |
| QRIS                 | Failure during refund process                                                                                                                                            | Amount is less than 55,000 or greater than 66,000 | Refund Failed     |
| E-Wallet - LinkAja   | Failure during refund process                                                                                                                                            | Amount is less than 55,000 or greater than 66,000 | Refund Failed     |


**Mock Credentials for Testing**

Specifically for payment via Credit Card or Debit Card, you may use the below credentials to simulate an end-to-end payment joruney for a successful transaction in staging environment

| Card Details          | Values                     |
| ----------------------| ---------------------------|
|Card Number            | 2223000000000007           |
|Card Expired Month/Year| 01/39                      |
|Card CVN               | 100                        |
|Card Holder Name       | Testing                    |


**Simulate Credit Card / Debit Card Transaction Callback for Testing**
As an alternative to the above, if you would like to simulate the callback for Credit Card or Debit Card transaction, but not necessarily the end-to-end payment journey, you may manually send callback by following these steps: 

1. Log in to your OY! Dashboard 
2. Select Environment: Demo in the top left corner 
3. Make sure to have inputted your staging callback URL on Settings: 'Developer Options' (tab: Callback Configuration - Payment Link)
4. Create a payment link in Demo environment
5. Click on the link and proceed with Credit Card or Debit Card as your payment method 
6. Copy the Reference Number of the transaction - it should be available under "Transaction Details" 
7. Return to OY! Dashboard and click on the Settings: 'CC-DC Callback" 
8. Paste the Reference Number of the transaction and choose whether you would like to simulate a callback for successful transaction or a failed transaction 
8. Click "Send Callback". OY! will only send callback for a successful transaction whether in staging environment or production environment

### E-Wallet Product Flow

![E-Wallet API](../images/ewallet_product_flow.png)

### Key Features

1.  **Support multiple e-wallets** - We support ShopeePay, LinkAja, DANA, and OVO
2.  **Transaction tracking and monitoring capability** - You can track all created e-wallet transactions, incoming payments, and their respective details through our API callback or OY! dashboard. You will receive a callback for all incoming transactions.
3.  **Check Status capability** - We have a Check Status endpoint available for you to regularly check the status of an e-wallet transaction

### Registration and Setup

Follow the below check-list to ensure you're all set up to use our E-Wallet API service:

1.  Create an account
2.  Upgrade your account by submitting the required documentations
3.  Have your upgrade request approved
4.  Set up your receiving bank account information (note: ensure that the receiving bank account information is accurate as it cannot be changed via OY! dashboard for security reasons)

6.  Receive an API Key from us (note: it is required for API authorization purpose)
7.  Integrate with our E-Wallet API

### Testing

When you hit Create E-Wallet Transaction endpoint (https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#https-request-create-e-wallet-transaction), it will always return the same ewallet_url & success_redirect URL in the response: https://pay-dev.shareitpay.in/aggregate-pay-gate. You cannot simulate payment by clicking this URL.

In order to be able to simulate payment (change the transaction status into Complete), follow the steps below: (Note: the process of simulating payment in Staging environment doesn't involve any forward / redirection to the E-Wallet apps, the scope is just changing the transaction status into Complete.)


1.  Create an account
2.  Send a request to activate API E-Wallet product and obtain staging API Key to your business representative
3.  Create a transaction by sending a ‘POST’ request to https://api-stg.oyindonesia.com/api/e-wallet-aggregator/create-transaction using your staging API key. Enter the required and optional fields, as referenced in the API reference docs (https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#api-e-wallet-aggregator)
4.  After an E-Wallet transaction is generated, you can simulate an E-Wallet payment through their dashboard (in Staging environment) by going to the "E-Wallet" sidebar, look for the newly created transaction row on the table (should be at the top), then click on the "Pay" button on the very right of that row. ![E-Wallet Table](../images/ewallet_testing_2.png)
5.  Fill in the e-wallet name, the ref number and amount should be prefilled from the transaction in the previous step, then click on "Send Callback" ![E-Wallet API](../images/ewallet_testing.png)
6.  If a payment is successful, we will send a callback to the registered staging callback URL destination
7.  The payment made to the e-wallet transaction can be monitored through OY! dashboard, in the "E-Wallet" sidebar

### How to Use

We provide 2 endpoints for you to use:

- [Create E-Wallet Transaction](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#api-e-wallet-aggregator): Use this API to create an e-wallet transaction for your user
- [Check E-Wallet Transaction Status](https://api-docs.oyindonesia.com/#https-request-check-e-wallet-transaction-status): Use this API to check the status of an e-wallet transaction. We highly recommend that you implement this endpoint.

All details regarding your created e-wallet and its payments can be retrieved via our API endpoint (Check E-Wallet Transaction Status) or can be monitored directly from the OY! dashboard (through the E-Wallet sidebar)

## Understanding Cards Transaction 

### How to Activate 

If you need to accept payments from your end-users via debit and/or credit cards, you may contact your Business Representative for more information and assistance on the activation process. 


### Products Available 

You may receive credit and/or debit card payments via Payment Link or Payment Routing.


### Supported Networks 

We currently support Mastercard, Visa, and JCB transactions. To protect you and your end-users from fraudulent payment attempts, all transactions will be processed with 3D Secure (i.e. 3DS). 


### Payments via Cards

To increase the chance of successful transaction, please ensure that your end-users:

1. Have sufficient balance or credit limit for the transaction

2. Have enabled 3D Secure (3DS) as a way to authenticate the transaction


### Understanding Overseas Transactions

Your end-users may use credit and/or debit cards issued locally or internationally. If you plan to conduct overseas transactions, it is important to note that OY! can only create the transactions in IDR. This means that your end-users can still use their overseas cards for payment, however the card will still be charged in IDR and settlement will also be done in IDR. The cardholder's billing statement, however, will show the transaction amount in their local currency with foreign exchange rate & extra fees (if any) as applied by their issuer (i.e. the bank or entity that issues the card).


Some cards issuer might not allow overseas transactions. Therefore, it is recommended for your end-users to check with their issuing bank regarding country restrictions to reduce the chance of the transaction being declined by the issuer. 


### Transactions Declined By Issuer 

When a transaction attempt is submitted to your end-user’s issuer (i.e. the bank or entity that issues the card), they usually have an automated system and parameters that help them in deciding whether or not to authorize the transaction. The parameters may include, but not limited to, behavior from past transactions, card details such as expiration date and CVV, and availability of funds. 


If all of the card details seem correct, the funds are available and 3DS has been enabled for the card, it is possible that the transaction is declined by the issuer. Unfortunately, sometimes the decline reason provided by the issuer is too “generic”. If that’s the case, you may ask your end-users to either use alternative cards or payment methods or to contact their issuer directly for more information on the decline reason. Due to privacy & security concerns, issuers can only discuss the specific reason why a transaction is declined to the respective cardholder. This means that issuer will most likely not entertain decline explanation requests via OY!. 




## Feature: Resend Callback

### Key Features

Retry Callback allows you to resend a callback for your successful transaction to your system. Initially, OY! will send a callback to your system after your transaction status has been converted to success. If your system failed to receive the callback, this feature can help you to retry the callback process. The process can be done in two ways


1. Automated retry callback
If on the first try the callback is not successfully received, the system will automatically retry the callback delivery. If that callback still not received by the clients'  system, the system will automatically retry until 5 occurence. The interval of the sending process will be detailed in Callback Interval section. If all automated Retry Callback have been sent but still returned failed, system will send email notification to email address that has been set in the configuration.

2. Manual retry callback
Beside the automated process, you can manually request a callback.

### Registration and Set Up

Follow the instruction below to activate retry callback

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
2. Open “Settings” and choose “Developer Option”. Choose “Callback Configuration”
3. Fill your callback URL in the related product that you want to activate. Make sure the format is right. You can click URL String Validation button to validate the URL format.
4. If you want to activate automated retry callback, check the Enable Automatic Retry Callback and fill in the email. The email will be used to receive a notification if all the automatic callback attempts have been made but still fail
5. Click "Save Changes". The configuration will not able to be saved if the callback URL or/and email format are not valid.


![Resend Callback](../images/retry_callback_developer_option.png)

Don't forget to whitelist these IPs in order to be able to receive callback from OY: 54.151.191.85 and 54.179.86.72

If you want to manually resend a callback, you can follow the instruction below

1. Login to your account in OY! Dashboard
2. Open the desired product menu


Payment Link: open "Payment Link" and choose "One Time"/"Reusable"
VA Aggregator: open "Virtual Account" menu and choose "Incoming Payment"
Ewallet Aggregator: open "E-Wallet" menu

3. If the product is VA Aggregator or Ewallet Aggregator, click "Resend Callback" button in the related transaction
4. If the product product is Payment Link, click 3 dots in the related transaction and click "Resend Callback"


![Resend Callback](../images/payment_link_resend_callback.png)

![Resend Callback](../images/reusable_resend_callback.png)

![Resend Callback](../images/va_resend_callback.png)

![Resend Callback](../images/ewallet_resend_callback.png)



### Callback Interval
1st retry: realtime (after the first failed log received)
2nd retry: 1 min (after callback failed log for the 1st retry is received)
3rd retry: 2 mins (after callback failed log for the 2nd retry is received)
4th retry: 13 mins (after callback failed log for the 3rd retry is received)
5th retry: 47 mins (after callback failed log for the 4th retry is received)

If all automated Retry Callback (all the 5 attempts) has been sent but we still get a Failed response from your end, our system will send an automated email notification to the  email address that has been set in the configuration earlier


### Idempotency Key
To implement automated retry callback, you need to handle the idempotency logic in your system using the below key:

Payment Link - Invoice: tx_ref_number
VA: trx_id
Ewallet: trx_id OR ref_number

## Feature: Refund E-wallet

### Key Features
Refund features allow you to refund a successful e-wallet transaction to your end-users. A refund can either be full or partial. A full refund will give your end-users or payers their entire payment amount back (100%). A partial refund will return up to the total amount paid to your end-users or payers. These requirements must be met in order for a refund transaction to be issued:

1. Refunds can only be issued up to 7 days after transaction is success/complete.
2. You have enough balance that allows us to deduct the amount of the transaction that should be refunded.
3. A refund can only be issued once, whether it is a full or partial refund.
